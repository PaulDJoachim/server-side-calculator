# JQUERY SERVER SIDE CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

This application works as a calculator that can perform operations on two numbers. The backspace button will delete the last character entered, the 'CE' button will delete all input on the display, and the AC button will clear all previous calculations. A calculation can be re-calculated by clicking it in the list of results.
